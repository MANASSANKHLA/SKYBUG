                 The purpose of this project is to develop a website that provides e-menu cards with a QR Code to restaurant or cafe owners to show they can put those QR codes on restaurant tables. This will allow customers to access the menu on their mobile devices without the need for physical menus, which can reduce contact and promote hygiene. 
            
                    Traditional physical menus pose challenges in terms of hygiene and frequent updates. They require printing, and distribution, and are subject to wear and tear. With the rapid advancement of technology, there is a growing demand for innovative and efficient solutions that can enhance the dining experience for both customers and owners. 
                    
                    MenuWave offers a comprehensive and user-friendly website for restaurant and cafe owners to create and choose their digital menus. By generating unique QR codes for each menu, the system seamlessly integrates the digital menus with physical tables, enabling customers to access them conveniently using their mobile devices.
